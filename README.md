This is the repository that contains the code for the tasks of Team Anant, payload task.

`pixel-binning.ipynb` is the file that contains the code for task 1. It implements the pixel binning function.

`logit-binomial.ipynb` is the file that contains a binomial clasifier using logistic regression. I started with this as this is the most common use of logit and this is what I knew slightly before hand.

`logit-multi.ipynb` is the file that containts the code for task 2. It is the final submission.
